            There may have been moments in your life where you've notice the hype coming from a group of people around
            you. If you've engaged and found the topic to not be so interesting or relevant to your life, that is
            understandable because these subjects may not seem to apply to your current life such as ChatGPT. However
            even though it may seem like it is irrelevant in you life at the moment, it may affect other infrastructures
            around you which may cascade down to affecting your life. ChatGPT, the latest new technology that
            has recently come out that is, can negatively or positively
            affect many things that could lead to you. For example:
            <ul>
              <li>If you are a student: ChatGPT may change how the grading system works to adapt to ChatGPT
                interference, which may require efforts to adapt on your part as well.</li>
              <li>If you have a job: Depending on what profession you are in, ChatGPT may make it's way to your
                workspace and possible affect your work policies in the future.</li>
              <li>One way or another ChatGPT may appear somewhere in your life and affect you indirectly. Whenever it
                directly affects you however, you at least know where you stand.</li>

          Not only can it affect us, but the society we live in. Slowly the higher levels of society will adapt to this
          technology, not only adopting the issues that come with it but also reinforcing these issues for the rest of
          society. Below are some of the infrastructures that are affected by ChatGPT and what it may mean for our
          society in the future regarding problems:

            There are many ways to decide how to address these issues. Because of our bias as Informatics students who
            have been learning the ways of bonding humans with technology however, we will address these issues with an
            Informatics lens. That is, we think to solve the issues by doing these things:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Stay Informed: What is a conversation without knowledge? If we want to start understanding how to solve
                issues created by ChatGPT, we must first understand how it works and where it is going.
              </li>
              <li>
                Inform others: Like we mentioned before, helping keep everyone in the loop can increase the speed for
                which we can address these issues and discover new ideas for preventing them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Discuss: It isn’t enough to tell people about it, it’s also to get them involved and to understand where
                they are coming from. Of course we keep things respectful and give them their space to comfortably
                divulge ideas.
              </li>
              <li>
                Form a community: Lastly, we won’t be able to move anything by ourselves, more or less the powerful
                companies that back these technologies, and so we will become just as strong as them by banding together
                to address these issues that may affect our lives. If noone else will, then we can.
